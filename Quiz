Explain what inheritance is.
Inheritance is a concept in OOP revolving around classes and their subclasses.
Inheritance is implemented with at least two or more classes or objects. 
In a two-class case, one class is referred to as the 'superclass' and the other is the 'subclass.'
The subclass extends the superclass, *inheriting* its fields, methods, and behaviors.

Explain what polymorphism is.
Polymorphism is a concept in OOP revolving around methods.
With polymorphism, a method with the same name can have multiple different functions
depending on the object it acts upon. The method's behavior is unique to the object it acts upon.
It is a kind of method overloading.
